# Revamped Polytoria Documentation

This is a fork of the new-docs branch on the Polytoria Scripting Documentation GitHub repository which you can find [here](https://github.com/Polytoria/Docs/tree/new-docs). That branch has been unmaintained for a while so this is a maintained version as it would be a shame to let such an improved documentation experience just collect dust. We hope to have all of this documentation filled out soon.
