# Getting Started

To get you started with making your own places, you may use the Documentation and Tutorials here to learn the Creator as well as the Scripting API.

View [Setting up Polytoria Creator](/tutorials/getting-started/creator-setup/) to set up the Creator and view [Understanding Creator's Interface](/tutorials/getting-started/creator-interface/) to learn the Creator Interface.

If you are ready to learn further, you may visit [Basic Scripting](/tutorials/basic-scripting/) to begin learning scripting on Polytoria.
